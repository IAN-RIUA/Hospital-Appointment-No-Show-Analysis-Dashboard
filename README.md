## 📊 Project Overview

Missed appointments ("no-shows") are a common challenge in healthcare facilities, leading to resource waste and delayed treatments.  
This dashboard explores trends in patient attendance and provides insights hospitals can use to reduce no-show rates.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify patterns that influence patient no-shows.  
- Analyze demographic factors such as **age** and **gender**.  
- Evaluate the impact of **SMS reminders** on attendance.  
- Build an **interactive dashboard** for easy exploration.
